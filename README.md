AI for soldier and a dinosaur like object that follow and attack the player , each in it's own way .


This game is an environment to test AI behaviour with two enemy archetypes (Dinosaur - Soldier)

the soldier and the dino have the routines of following the player , seeking him as he fades out of sight. 
(both of which inherit the same class and extend behaviour)

the soldier shoots at the player once in range of shooting 

the dinosaur gets close enoguh to the player and rolls a dice to decide whether to circulate around the player or hit him (melee attack).

Here is some debugging screenshots
